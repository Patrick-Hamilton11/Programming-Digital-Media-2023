# The Nearly Impossible Game

The Nearly Impossible Game is inspired by an old flash game called the impossible game. The games graphics were made using p5.js and the music and sounds were made using Tone.js. Also I made a controller using an arduino and a single joystick. The objective of the game is to collect all the clons each level while avoiding the mocing obsticles. There are currently 3 levels in the game that get progressivly harder. The game keeps track of your deaths and time for each level.
